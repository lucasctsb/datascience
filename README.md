# Data Science Case Studies and Code Examples

This repository contains a collection of data science case studies and code examples covering a range of topics in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. These examples are intended to provide practical insights and solutions to common data science problems.

#Contents
The repository is organized into subdirectories, each containing a specific case study or example:

classification: examples of classification problems and solutions using various algorithms
clustering: examples of clustering problems and solutions using various algorithms
data_cleaning: examples of data cleaning techniques and best practices
dimensionality_reduction: examples of dimensionality reduction techniques and their applications
exploratory_data_analysis: examples of exploratory data analysis techniques and visualizations
feature_engineering: examples of feature engineering techniques and their impact on model performance
model_evaluation: examples of model evaluation metrics and techniques
natural_language_processing: examples of NLP techniques and applications
regression: examples of regression problems and solutions using various algorithms
time_series: examples of time series analysis and forecasting techniques
Usage
Each subdirectory contains its own README file with a brief overview of the case study or example and instructions for running the code. All code is provided in Jupyter notebook format for easy execution and modification.
